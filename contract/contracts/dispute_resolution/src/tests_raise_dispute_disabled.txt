# Raise Dispute Tests Disabled

The following tests have been temporarily disabled because they require
cross-contract calls to the chioma contract for agreement validation:

- test_raise_dispute_success
- test_raise_dispute_fails_when_already_exists  
- test_raise_dispute_fails_with_empty_details_hash

These will be re-enabled once integration test infrastructure is set up.
